<h1>What are drugs?</h1>
<p id = "givesomestyle">A <i> drug</i> is any substance (with the exception of food and water) which, when taken into the body, alters
   the bodys function either physically and/or psychologically. Drugs may be <strong>legal</strong> (e.g. <i>alcohol, caffeine and tobacco</i>)
   or <strong>illegal</strong> (e.g. <i>cocaine, ecstasy and heroin</i>).
   <strong>Psychoactive drugs</strong> affect the central nervous system and alter a person's <i>mood, thinking and behaviour</i>.
   Psychoactive drugs may be divided into four categories: <strong>depressants, stimulants, hallucinogens and 'other'.</strong>
   Drugs are typically distinguished from food and substances that provide nutritional support.
   Consumption of drugs can be via <strong>inhalation, injection, smoking, ingestion, absorption via a patch on the skin, or dissolution under the tongue.</strong>
</p>
<h1>What drugs are commonly used?</h1>
<p>
<strong><i>Caffeine</i></strong> is one of the most popular drugs, with average consumption estimated to be <strong>70mg per person per day</strong> (54% of this is from coffee, 43% from tea and 3% from other forms).
The 2010 National Drug Strategy Household Survey reported that in Western America alcohol and tobacco were more commonly used than any illicit drug in the last 12 months.
<strong>There is no safe level of illicit drug use.</strong> The user can never tell exactly what an illegal drug contains, or what effect it will have, and this puts people at serious risk.
</p>


<h1>Death due to drugs</h1>
<p>Drug overdose deaths, continue to increase in the United States. <strong>Deaths from drug overdose are up among
  both men and women, all races, and adults of nearly all ages.</strong>
<strong>Two out of three drug overdose deaths involve an opioid.</strong> Opioids are substances that work in the nervous
system of the body or in specific receptors in the brain to reduce the intensity of pain. Overdose deaths
from opioids, including prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids (like fentanyl) have increased
almost six times since 1999. Overdoses involving opioids killed more than 47,000 people in 2017,
and 36% of those deaths involved prescription opioids.


States with <strong>statistically significant increases in drug overdose</strong> death rates from 2016 to 2017 included <strong>Alabama,
Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan
, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.</strong>
